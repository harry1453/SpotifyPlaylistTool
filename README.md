# SpotifyPlaylistTool
Android app for Spotify playlist management. Allows for creation of multi-playlists (playlists composed of multiple child playlists that auto updates when child playlists do)

## 2018 Update (by harry1453)

This project is mostly obsolete as Spotify has [finally implemented the ability to edit playlists](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Android-Rearrange-Tracks-inside-a-Playlist/idi-p/690366).

However, the app still has some use for its multi-playlists feature.
